# Sorter #

A simple Android app that compares the performance of various sorting algorithms side-by-side. Currently supports five different algorithms:

  * Bubble Sort
  * Insertion Sort
  * Merge Sort
  * Quick Sort
  * Selection Sort

Algorithms are displayed as they sort 30 'bars' of differing lengths that start in a random permutation.
